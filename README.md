# The-Kuramoto-model-
The Kuramoto model is a simple model describing a set of N nonlinear coupled phase oscillators.

The Kuramoto model presents some unusual phenomena, especially:
• for some parameters with large number of non-zero couplings, the Kuramoto model presents a self-synchronisation phenomenon: starting from random initial conditions {θi(0)}i, after a short time of transcient regime, the system is in a stable state where all the oscillators are synchroneous;
• for some parameters with large N, the Kuramoto model exhibits chimera states: starting from random initial conditions {θi(0)}i, after a short time of transcient regime, the system is in a metastable state where a part of the system synchroneously oscillates and an other part presents chaotic oscillations, without propagation of the chaos nor complete self synchronisation. Such a state is metastable, i.e. it seems stable during a long time larger than the transcient regime time, but after that, the system collapses into a completely chaotic or synchroneous state. The duration of the chimera regime grows with N (chimera states are stable at the limit N → +∞).


Surprisingly the Kuramoto model is a very good description of a lot of different concrete (physical, chemical and biological) systems.

The goal of this project is the realisation of a simulator of an array of Josephson junctions based on the Kuramoto model.
